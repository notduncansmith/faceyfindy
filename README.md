# FaceyFindy

This iPhone app allows you to train and use a facial recognition model with your camera.

## How it works

Detected faces appear in the bottom-right panel.

When in training mode (indicated by the red switch), detected faces will be added to the recognition model.

Once at least 5 training images have been saved, each face detected in recognition mode will be evaluated for distance from the model.

When you close the app, any gathered training data will not be saved.

## Limitations

As it is currently at the proof-of-concept stage, this app only trains/evaluates one model per session, and does not persist models between sessions.

Face detection is inconsistent. Having even lighting across the subject's face, and especially having them smile at least somewhat open-mouthed helps a lot with face detection. FaceyFindy uses the native face detection capabilities of iOS, which I would imagine are specifically adapted for face detection in photos people take with their phone (e.g. people smiling).

Face recognition is currently only somewhat accurate. This is because it's easy to blur the photos as one captures, and the current cropping solution doesn't attempt to cut out background noise. This should get much better once we add ways of getting images besides capturing faces from the camera.

Finally, it makes the shutter sound multiple times per second, so don't use this app your phone's sound on. I'd love to fix this eventually, but right now it seems like [more trouble than it's worth](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4401232/avfoundation-how-to-turn-off-the-shutter-sound-when-capturestillimageasynchrono).

## Future enhancements

- [ ] Support multiple (saved/named) models

- [ ] Support non-camera data sources (image search, Facebook friends, etc)

- [ ] Support pruning model inputs (editable photo grid or something)

- [ ] Include models for a few well-known faces

- [ ] Add automated tests for functionality and accuracy

- [ ] Improve accuracy (detection and recognition)

- [ ] Improve prediction UI (as ðŸ”¥ as a rapid stream of labels is, it'd be neat to have something more organic-feeling)

## Learnings

- iOS drawing and graphics systems

- Processing images with `CoreImage` and `CGAffineTransform`s

  - This was harder than it looked by a mile. Many online tutorials for drawing boxes around faces fail to correctly handle image orientation, but look like they work because they're tested on non-mirrored stock images where a face appears dead-center and thus fails to reveal orientation issues. Also, the docs around matrix transforms have [issues](http://www.joeschwartz.com/2014/10/02/video-preview-and-facial-recognition-in-swift/).

- Debug/etc flags in Swift projects (more convenient than they used to be, apparently)

- Theory and practical application of various facial recognition algorithms, including Eigenfaces, Fisherfaces, and Local Binary Pattern Histograms (LBPH)

- C++ library integration with Swift via Objective-C++
